Aim: Design an Automatic Night Lamp.
Apparatus: Arduino, LDR, LED, Resistor, wires, Breadboard.
Procedure:
step1:
take a arduino and breadboard first.
step2:
take 1 lcd and 2 resistors with a single light detecting(ldr).
step3:
now join them in a circuit to check the functioning of ldr with light
step4:
now check the brightness and change it slowly.
step5:
it works at range>500 it glow.
Result:
Automatic night lamp functioning was verified after uploading the program
